# Student_Resource_Management

Created this project in 2015!! as a course project using php, javescript, html, css (no framework). Found it in my google drive (didn't upload to git?). Anyway, it helped a lot of my classmates back in the days :P. Lost some of the files. But, the base is ok. Only have to add some features. Nice project boilerplate for a course.
